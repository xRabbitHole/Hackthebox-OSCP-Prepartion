# Hackthebox-OSCP-Prepartion

Hello everyone, my name is Alessandro, I am a fan of astrophysics, cinema, fitness but above all cybersecurity. 
With this project, I want to keep track of all hacked Hack the Box machines on the [TJ_null list] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) in preparation for the OSCP certification which I hope to achieve as soon as possible. 

I write these write-ups in Italian in the hope of helping those who have difficulty with the English language, given the shortage of materials in Italian. I hope it helps and happy reading to all
